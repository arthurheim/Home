    "text": "On April 22, 2024 at 5 PM (Paris time), I defended my thesis:\nSocial Investment and the Changing Face of Poverty: Essays on the Design and Evaluation of Social Investment Policies in France.\nJury:\n\nMme Anne BORING, Erasmus University Rotterdam\nM. Rafael LALIVE, Université de Lausanne\nMme Karen MACOURS, INRAE, PSE-Ecole d’économie de Paris\nMme Camille TERRIER, Queen Mary University of London\n\n \nThesis supervisor:\n\nM. Marc GURGAND, CNRS, PSE-Ecole d’économie de Paris\n\n\nRage against the Matching (with Julien Combe)\nWe use market design to define assignment mechanisms for the daycare market. We conduct a field experiment using them in France and analyse who gets what and why.\n \nWelfare to What ?\nI evaluate a randomised experiment of an intensive welfare-to-work programme targetting single parents on long-term welfare in France. I find no effect on labour market participation and poverty after the end of the programme.\n \nTax burden on the poor (with Alexandra galitzine)\nWe challenge the idea that the French tax-benefit system “make work pay” for single parents and analyse reactions following a randomised intensive welfare-to-work programme."

    "text": "About me\nI am an applied economist working on the design and evaluation of public policies to reduce inequalities and poverty in France. I combine field experiments and microeconometrics to study the effects of active labour market policies for single mothers and how administrative support and information can improve access to early childcare services. I also use market design and implement fair assignment mechanisms for daycare seats in French municipalities.\n\n\nA bit more about me\nI did my PhD in Economics at Paris School of Economics (EHESS) from 2019 to 2024 at the National family allowance fund (Cnaf)."
