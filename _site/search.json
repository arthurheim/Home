I combine field experiments and microeconometrics to study the effects of active labour market policies for single mothers and how administrative support and information can improve access to early childcare services. I also use market design and implement fair assignment mechanisms for daycare seats in French municipalities."

Rafael LALIVE, Université de Lausanne\nMme Karen MACOURS, INRAE, PSE-Ecole d’économie de Paris\nMme Camille TERRIER, Queen Mary University of London\n\n \nThesis supervisor:\n\nM. Marc GURGAND, CNRS, PSE-Ecole d’économie de Paris\n\n\n\nWhat is this dissertation about ?\nRage against the Matching (with Julien Combe)\nWe use market design to define assignment mechanisms for the daycare market. We conduct a field experiment using them in France and analyse who gets what and why.\n \nWelfare to What ?\nI evaluate a randomised experiment of an intensive welfare-to-work programme targetting single parents on long-term welfare in France. I find no effect on labour market participation and poverty after the end of the programme.\n \nTax burden on the poor (with Alexandra galitzine)\nWe challenge the idea that the French tax-benefit system “make work pay” for single parents and analyse reactions following a randomised intensive welfare-to-work programme."

    "text": "The ISAJE Project\n\nWith Julien Combe\n\n\n\nPolicies to foster access to formal childcare\n\nWith Laudine Carbuccia, Carlo Baronne & Coralie Chevalier\nAccess to early childcare for low socioeconomic status (SES) families has the potential to mitigate socioeconomic inequalities. Yet, there is an SES-based gap in early childcare enrolment. While low-SES families would benefit the most from attending early childcare, they access early childcare the least. We study cognitive and behavioural barriers behind this access gap assessing the effectiveness of informational interventions and personalised administrative support in enhancing early childcare application and access for low-SES families through a multi-arm experiment. Results reveal that the information-only treatment had minimal impact. Combining information and personalised administrative support significantly bridges the SES-gap in early childcare applications for those who receive support. However, despite large impacts on application rates, we find limited impact on access rates for low-SES families. Our study provides key insights for policymakers aiming to promote equitable access to high-quality early childcare."
