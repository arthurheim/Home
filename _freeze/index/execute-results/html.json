I did my PhD in Economics at Paris School of Economics (EHESS) from 2019 to 2024 at the National family allowance fund (Cnaf).\n\nI combine field experiments and microeconometrics to study the effects of active labour market policies for single mothers and how administrative support and information can improve access to early childcare services. I also use market design and implement fair assignment mechanisms for daycare seats in French municipalities.\n\nI am currently working as project manager in the Research Evaluation and Statistics department (DSER) of the French National family allowance fund (Cnaf).\n\n* {{< iconify fa6-brands:bluesky size=1em title='Bluesky'>}} [heimarthur.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/heimarthur.bsky.social)\n\n* <i class=\"fas fa-envelope\"></i> [heimarthur\\@gmail.com](mailto:heimarthur@gmail.com)",
