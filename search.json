Rafael LALIVE, Université de Lausanne\nMme Karen MACOURS, INRAE, PSE-Ecole d’économie de Paris\nMme Camille TERRIER, Queen Mary University of London\n\n \nThesis supervisor:\n\nM.

We conduct a field experiment using them in France and analyse who gets what and why.\nWelfare to What ?\nI evaluate a randomised experiment of an intensive welfare-to-work programme targetting single parents on long-term welfare in France. I find no effect on labour market participation and poverty after the end of the programme.\nTax burden on the poor (with Alexandra galitzine)\nWe challenge the idea that the French tax-benefit system “make work pay” for single parents and analyse reactions following a randomised intensive welfare-to-work programme."

    "text": "heimarthur@gmail.com\nI am an applied economist working on the design and evaluation of public policies to reduce inequalities and poverty in France. I combine field experiments and microeconometrics to study the effects of active labour market policies for single mothers and how administrative support and information can improve access to early childcare services. I also use market design and implement fair assignment mechanisms for daycare seats in French municipalities.\nI did my PhD in Economics at Paris School of Economics (EHESS) from 2019 to 2024 at the National family allowance fund (Cnaf).\nThis webiste is currently being built and is regularly updated."
