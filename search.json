Scientists design general frames, engineers turn them into relevant machinery, and plumbers finally make them work in a complicated, messy policy environment. […] A feature unique to economics is that scientists, engineers, and plumbers all talk to each other (and in fact are often talking to themselves — the same economist wearing different hats)” Duflo (2017)\n\n\nDuflo, Esther. 2017. “The Economist as Plumber.” American Economic Review 107 (5): 1–26. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.p20171153.\n\n\n\nThis website is currently being built and is regularly updated."

I paused playing sax at age 13-something, stole a guitar from my dad and learned.\nIn my adult life, I’ve been playing guitar, lapsteel, bass and sax in a bunch of bands. In particular, I wrote recorded and co-produced the album Hysteresis from Kera, a progressive death metal band active from 2015 to 2020 (Listen to the opening in Figure 1).\nMy music is mostly Rock and Metal although I enjoy and play many different styles.\nBelow, you can watch and listen to some of my favourite’s."

After a first EP in November 2014, a single in February 2016, Kera Released a full album in November 2017.\nHysteresis is a concept album dealing with mental illness and the persistence of emotional traumas. Songs are rather long (5 out of 9 are longer than 7 minutes), and use lots of complex musical theme (modulations and non symmetric metrics). This album is inspired with all Kera’s influences, leading the auditor into its universe, in which violent and effective riff can be heard right after some aerial parts. Textures’ lead guitarist: Joe Tal plays the solo of the new version of Delusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: The video “Kera: Delusion”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: The video “Kera: Harbinger of Doom”"
