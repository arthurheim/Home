We conduct a field experiment using them in France and analyse who gets what and why.\nWelfare to What ?\nI evaluate a randomised experiment of an intensive welfare-to-work programme targetting single parents on long-term welfare in France. I find no effect on labour market participation and poverty after the end of the programme.\nTax burden on the poor (with Alexandra galitzine)\nWe challenge the idea that the French tax-benefit system “make work pay” for single parents and analyse reactions following a randomised intensive welfare-to-work programme."

I combine field experiments and microeconometrics to study the effects of active labour market policies for single mothers and how administrative support and information can improve access to early childcare services. I also use market design and implement fair assignment mechanisms for daycare seats in French municipalities.\nI did my PhD in Economics at Paris School of Economics (EHESS) from 2019 to 2024 at the National family allowance fund (Cnaf).\nThis webiste is currently being built and is regularly updated."

Yet, there is an SES-based gap in early childcare enrolment. While low-SES families would benefit the most from attending early childcare, they access early childcare the least. We study cognitive and behavioural barriers behind this access gap assessing the effectiveness of informational interventions and personalised administrative support in enhancing early childcare application and access for low-SES families through a multi-arm experiment. Results reveal that the information-only treatment had minimal impact. Combining information and personalised administrative support significantly bridges the SES-gap in early childcare applications for those who receive support. However, despite large impacts on application rates, we find limited impact on access rates for low-SES families. Our study provides key insights for policymakers aiming to promote equitable access to high-quality early childcare.\n\n\nDraft available SOON"
