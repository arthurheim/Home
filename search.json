    "section": "",
    "text": "I‚Äôm pleased to share a new preprint now submitted to the European Economic Review: ‚ÄúWelfare-to-What? Experimental Evaluation of an Activation Programme for Single Mothers in Poverty in France.‚Äù üìÑ Read the paper here\n\nWhat This Paper Is About\nThis study presents one of the rare randomised evaluations of a welfare-to-work (WtW) programme in Europe and the first of its kind in France. Between 2018 and 2022, we evaluated a highly intensive WtW programme targeting long-term welfare-dependent single mothers in a large urban district.\nThe evaluation relies on an encouragement design among four cohorts of roughly 400 participants each and extensive matched administrative data on employment, income, and social benefits.\n\n\nKey Findings\n\nLock-in effects dominate early on: Employment and income dropped significantly during the programme (‚Äì8pp relative to a 20% baseline).\nNo long-term employment gains: After the programme ended, participants were no more likely to be employed or out of poverty than the counterfactual up to 36 months from random assignment.\nCash transfers rose: Treated households received more in social benefits over time‚Äîsuggesting either a drop in earned income or larger household sizes.\nSelection bias matters: Standard difference-in-differences models using rich covariates failed to recover experimental estimates. Non-experimental evaluations would have erroneously concluded the programme worked.\nNo effects during or after COVID: Treatment effects were consistent across cohorts, with no evidence that the pandemic distorted the findings.\n\n \n\n\nPolicy Implications\nDespite good intentions and generous resources (‚âà ‚Ç¨2,800 per participant, 4√ó the usual), the programme did not help participants find stable employment or exit poverty. If anything, it imposed opportunity costs on already-vulnerable mothers.\nThese results caution against assuming that intensive WtW programmes will ‚Äúpay for themselves‚Äù through reduced welfare rolls or improved earnings. They also show that caseworkers tend to refer higher-potential individuals, inflating the apparent effectiveness of such programmes when not evaluated with randomisation.\nFinally, the findings arrive just as France rolls out a major reform making activation mandatory for all welfare recipients‚Äîincluding single parents. This paper provides an upper bound on what such policies might achieve, and it urges a rethinking of how we define and measure ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù in activation strategies."

    "text": "We are thrilled to announce that our paper, Investigating how administrative burden and information costs affect social inequalities in early childcare access, has been accepted for publication in Nature Human Behaviour.\n\nBackground\nWhile high-quality early childcare yields the greatest benefits for low-income and immigrant families, these groups remain systematically under-represented in formal childcare settings‚Äîeven in France, where childcare is comparatively affordable and widely available. This gap persists despite strong parental intentions to use such services.\nOur study investigates whether cognitive and behavioural barriers‚Äîrather than cost or availability‚Äîcontribute to this ‚Äúintention-to-application‚Äù gap.\n\n\nStudy Design\nWe conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 1,849 pregnant women in the Paris region. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups:\n\nControl group: Received unrelated information (e.g., maternal health).\nInformation-only group: Received videos and reminders about early childcare options, costs, and how to apply.\nInformation + support group: Received the same materials plus personalised phone-based assistance with the application process.\n\nOur main outcomes were application and access to any formal early childcare, as well as to daycare centres specifically.\n\n\nKey Findings\n\nInformation alone did not increase application or access rates.\nPersonalized support increased application rates, particularly among low-SES and immigrant households.\n\nAmong compliers, the intervention nearly closed the application gap by SES and migration background.\n\nAccess rates, however, remained largely unchanged, except for a few subgroups (e.g., high-SES, dual-earner families).\nDaycare-specific access increased for high-SES mothers only, suggesting persistent structural allocation biases.\n\nWe also found that the support intervention had larger effects among:\n\nMothers with low prior knowledge of the childcare system,\nFamilies with no prior experience using early childcare,\nMothers who were inactive in the labour market,\nAnd those with present-oriented preferences or low trust in the childcare system.\n\n\n\nPolicy Implications\nOur findings point to a dual challenge:\n\nCognitive and behavioural barriers, such as low procedural knowledge, choice overload, and psychological costs, can be addressed with low-touch, scalable interventions.\nBut structural barriers, such as opaque prioritization criteria, discretionary selection, and potential discrimination, persist even after application barriers are removed.\n\nFor equitable access to early childcare, information and support are necessary‚Äîbut not sufficient. Policy makers should complement behavioural tools with reforms to slot allocation rules, priority criteria transparency, and local supply equity. Without tackling both layers, inequalities in access will remain entrenched.\n\nüìÑ Read the full paper: https://osf.io/preprints/osf/w2ey7_v4"
