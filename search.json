I did my PhD in Economics at Paris School of Economics (EHESS) from 2019 to 2024 at the National family allowance fund (Cnaf).\n I received the 2025 best dissertation award from the Cour des comptes.\n I combine field experiments and microeconometrics to study the effects of active labour market policies for single mothers and how administrative support and information can improve access to early childcare services. I also use market design and implement fair assignment mechanisms for daycare seats in French municipalities.\n I am currently working as project manager in the Research Evaluation and Statistics department (DSER) of the French National family allowance fund (Cnaf).\n\n\n\n\n heimarthur.bsky.social\n heimarthur@gmail.com"

I started reading sheet-music at the same age I was learning words and started to play the Alto sax at age 6. I paused playing sax at age 13-something, stole a guitar from my dad and learned.\nIn my adult life, I’ve been playing guitar, lapsteel, bass and sax in a bunch of bands. In particular, I wrote recorded and co-produced the album Hysteresis from Kera, a progressive death metal band active from 2015 to 2020 (Listen to the opening in Figure 1).\nMy music is mostly Rock and Metal although I enjoy and play many different styles.\nBelow, you can watch and listen to some of my favourites’."

In 2019, the band recorded the Kryptshow album where I recorded the sax parts of two songs :\n\nVegas Zombie\nLe magasin des suicides\n\nSince I was doing my PhD at that time, I only went on tour a few time.

The band’s main influences are Textures, Hypno5e, Dream Theater, Opeth, Meshuggah and Gojira. After a first EP in November 2014, a single in February 2016, Kera Released a full album in November 2017.\nHysteresis is a concept album dealing with mental illness and the persistence of emotional traumas. Songs are rather long (5 out of 9 are longer than 7 minutes), and use lots of complex musical theme (modulations and non symmetric metrics). This album is inspired with all Kera’s influences, leading the auditor into its universe, in which violent and effective riff can be heard right after some aerial parts. Textures’ lead guitarist: Joe Tal plays the solo of the new version of Delusion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: The video “Kera: Delusion”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: The video “Kera: Harbinger of Doom”"
