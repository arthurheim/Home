    "text": "Why ?\n”Many of us chose economics because, ultimately, we thought science could be leveraged to make a positive change in the world. There are many different paths to get there. Scientists design general frames, engineers turn them into relevant machinery, and plumbers finally make them work in a complicated, messy policy environment. […] A feature unique to economics is that scientists, engineers, and plumbers all talk to each other (and in fact are often talking to themselves — the same economist wearing different hats)” Duflo (2017)\n\n\nDuflo, Esther. 2017. “The Economist as Plumber.” American Economic Review 107 (5): 1–26. https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.p20171153.\n\n\n\nThis webiste is currently being built and is regularly updated."
