I combine field experiments and microeconometrics to study the effects of active labour market policies for single mothers and how administrative support and information can improve access to early childcare services. I also use market design and implement fair assignment mechanisms for daycare seats in French municipalities.\n\n[Download My Resume](https://github.com/arthurheim/Data_DrivenResume/blob/main/ArthurHeim/AHeimPhD2024En/AHeimPhD2024En.pdf){.pdf}\n\n## A bit more about me\n\nI did my PhD in Economics at Paris School of Economics (EHESS) from 2019 to 2024 at the National family allowance fund (Cnaf).\n",
