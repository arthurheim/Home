I did my PhD in Economics at Paris School of Economics (EHESS) from 2019 to 2024 at the National family allowance fund (Cnaf).\n\n## What ?\n\nI combine field experiments and microeconometrics to study the effects of active labour market policies for single mothers and how administrative support and information can improve access to early childcare services. I also use market design and implement fair assignment mechanisms for daycare seats in French municipalities.\n\n## Where ?\n\nI am currently working as project manager in the Research Evaluation and Statistics department (DSER) of the French National family allowance fund (Cnaf).\n\n## Why ?\n\n”*Many of us chose economics because, ultimately, we thought science could be leveraged to make a positive change in the world. There are many different paths to get there. Scientists design general frames, engineers turn them into relevant machinery, and plumbers finally make them work in a complicated, messy policy environment. \\[...\\] A feature unique to economics is that scientists, engineers, and plumbers all talk to each other (and in fact are often talking to themselves — the same economist wearing different hats)”* @duflo2017\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n\n<!-- quarto publish gh-pages -->\n\n**This website is currently being built and is regularly updated**.\n",
