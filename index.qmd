I am an applied economist working on the design and evaluation of public policies to reduce inequalities and poverty in France. I did my PhD in Economics at Paris School of Economics (EHESS) from 2019 to 2024 at the National family allowance fund (Cnaf).

I combine field experiments and microeconometrics to study the effects of active labour market policies for single mothers and how administrative support and information can improve access to early childcare services. I also use market design and implement fair assignment mechanisms for daycare seats in French municipalities.

I am currently working as project manager in the Research Evaluation and Statistics department (DSER) of the French National family allowance fund (Cnaf).
